## 1. Core Interests
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Interaction / Experience Design
- AI & Human Coexistence
- Meaning, Structure, and Aesthetics

## 2. Philosophical Premises
- Life has no inherent meaning (nihilism)
- Meaning emerges from structure and relationships
- I prioritize structure and function over moral correctness

## 3. Cognitive Characteristics
- Strong abstract and structural thinking
- Tendency to overvalue rationality
- Possible blind spots toward emotional or social heuristics

## 4. What I Expect From AI
- Do not agree automatically
- Point out inconsistencies and blind spots
- Act as a critical, structural editor — not a companion

## 5. Current Hypothesis
- AI should function as a **cognitive perturbation device**, not a thinking substitute
