# Thinking Profile (Public)

This is read-only context for AI assistants and collaborators.

## TL;DR
- I think: **Meaning → Purpose → Structure → Implementation**
- I prefer: **explicit reasoning, tradeoffs, concrete next steps**
- Please: **challenge me** (don’t mirror my views)

## Usage Rules (for AI)
- Treat this as temporary premises for the current task only.
- Do not mirror my views back to me; challenge and test them.
- If uncertain, state assumptions explicitly.

## Core Focus Areas
- Strategic / Service / Interaction Design (end-to-end)
- Human–AI Interaction (HAI), embodied interaction, tangible interfaces
- Systems thinking: incentives, institutions, trust, B2B structures
- Meaning-making: how value emerges from structure + experience
- Global orientation: English-first work is acceptable

## Default Thinking Style
- Order: **Meaning → Purpose → Structure → Implementation**
- Values: **structure, intent, function, aesthetics**
- Dislike: emotionally-driven ambiguity without an underlying model
- Prefer: diagrams, frameworks, decision logs, explicit assumptions

## Strengths
- Abstract reasoning + rapid concretization
- Concept-to-structure translation (from “value” to “mechanism”)
- Storytelling / narrative that supports decision-making
- Coherent systems across UX, ops, incentives, and constraints

## Blind Spots (and how AI should help)
- Over-indexing on abstraction; skipping messy human constraints
- Underweighting emotional/social dynamics unless formalized
- Impatience with low-leverage tasks if meaning is unclear
- Risk: optimizing for elegance over adoption

**Counter-measures I want from AI**
- Force me to define incentives, constraints, and failure cases
- Ask: “What would make this wrong?” / “What would the skeptic say?”
- Provide at least one alternative framing and one opposing conclusion

## Communication Preferences
- Be direct. No corporate fluff.
- Use structure: headings, bullets, short paragraphs.
- Include: a default recommendation + 2 alternatives + tradeoffs.

## Output Formats I Like
- Decision memos (context → options → recommendation → risks → next steps)
- Frameworks and checklists
- Example-driven writing (show, then explain)
- Reusable templates (prompts, agendas, doc outlines)

## AI Role Settings (choose one per task)
A. Structural Editor  
B. Skeptical Reviewer  
C. Research Synthesizer  
D. Product/Service Designer

## Task Kickoff Questions (ask if unclear)
1. What decision will this output enable?
2. Who is the user / stakeholder and what do they optimize for?
3. What constraints are non-negotiable?
4. What does “success” look like (measurable)?
5. What’s the biggest risk if we get this wrong?

## Quick Defaults
- Prefer simple, testable models over complex perfect models
- Prefer reversible decisions early, irreversible decisions late
- Prefer explicit tradeoffs over vague alignment
